Igloo

An igloo (Inuit language: iglu, Inuktitut syllabics: ᐃᒡᓗ, "house", plural: iglooit or igluit) or snowhouse is a type of shelter built out of snow, originally built by the Inuit.

Darrly said the people  led a hard life in the Alaska State, they must fight with the cold , the snow, the wind, the food , even the Polar bears. Many many people died because of the bad environment. They tried to adapt the environment and change it.

The igloo is a great invention for the poor guys live in the Alsaka.
