When There Was Me and You

《High School Musical》

It's funny when you find yourself
 Looking from the outside
 I'm standing here but all I want
 Is to be over there
 Why did I let myself believe
 Miracles could happen
 'Cause now I have to pretend
 That I don't really care
 I thought you were my fairytale
 A dream when I'm not sleeping
 A wish upon a star that's coming true
 But everybody else could tell
 That I confused my feelings
 With the truth
 When there was me and you
 I swore I knew the melody
 That I heard you singing
 And when you smiled you made me feel
 Like I could sing along.
 But then you went and changed the words
 Now my heart is empty
 I'm only left with used-to-be's
 And once upon a song
 Now I know you're not a fairytale
 And dreams were meant for sleeping
 And wishes on a star just don't come true
 Cause now even I can tell
 That I confused my feelings
 With the truth
 Because I liked the view
 When there was me and you
 I can't believe
 That I could be so blind
 It's like you were floating
 while I was falling
 And I didn't mind
 Because I liked the view
 I thought you felt it too
 When there was me and you
