**READ WITH CAUTION: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**

The third chapter starts out with the group docking in the water city, Furni. Though a beautiful city, there seems to be some trouble. Kamuy, the pet wolf belonging to the boy Teo, has become suddenly vicious, and attacked Fa, the mayor's daugther and Teo's best friend. Fa, completely shocked, hasn't spoken since she was attacked. Teo went into the forest after Kamuy. Resident Knight Harris has posted a reward for the healing of Kamuy, even if they have to kill him.

[![The Legend of Dragoon（4）Chapter Three: Fate and Soul](http://simg.sinajs.cn/blog7style/images/common/sg_trans.gif)](http://photo.blog.sina.com.cn/showpic.html#blogid=57f94311010005ej&url=http://static14.photo.sina.com.cn/orignal/57f94311048361f228abd)


Before the group can get far, though, they need a boat liscense to travel the town. They'll find one at the inn. After they get the boat liscense, the group visits the Mayor of Furni and learn the story of Teo and Kamuy. Fa takes a liking to Shana, and Shana sings Fa her special lullabye that Dart taught her. Haschel is astounded...because his daughter, Claire, composed that lullabye! Hmm....

After Fa goes to sleep, Dart and Shana head outside and admire the moon...but Shana ruins this special moment by fainting, causing everyone to panic. The next morning, Shana is back to normal and the group goes to Evergreen Forest.

It turns out that Teo and Kamuy have been hiding in the Forest, and the group has the option to help heal Kamuy or to go onto Deningrad. On the way to Deningrad, Rose leaves because she has an "errand to run", and Meru leaves to visit her "parents". This leaves Dart, Albert, Shana, Kongol, and Haschel to go to Deningrad.

The rest of the group find themselves in the beautiful Crystal City Deningrad. Our heroes go to the temple and meet the High Priest Bishop Dille, who tells the story of Soa's Divine Tree. It appears the Tree of Life gave birth to the creatures of the world. In fact there was nothing in the world until Soa descended from the sky. He (she?) and his followers created the world. They planted a seed which became a great tree...the Divine Tree, which bore 108 fruits with various life forms, each filling the world. Although the Divine Tree completed its role, it is still protected by the Signets of Soa.

The legend of the Signets goes something like this: Winglies created the Signets to protect the Divne Tree and the last fruit. When the Signet is broken, the end of the world approaches. To prevent the "end of the world", people must eliminate evil in their hearts and live in honesty. It is the mission of the children of the Divine Tree.

To find out more, Bishop Dille suggests they visit Librarian Ute. Though a bit stuck up, the Librarian has vast knoweldge and encourages them to look through the books for more information.

Kongol finds out that the Winglies, who fly on "Wings of Light", had enough magical powers to create floating cities and fortresses that, after the Dragon Campaign, became extinct. Also, like the way Humans had Dragons, Winglies had Virages.

Shana finds out that Humans divided Endiness into four regions: To the east, Serdio; to the south, Tiberoa; to the north, Mille Seseau, and to the west, the untouched Death Frontier. There was made Divine Moon Objects that humans kept as symbols of peace between humans and Winglies; However, the humans did not know they contained magical powers.

Ute, Haschel and Albert make a comment about Dragons...Feyrbrand was the first Dragon seen since the end of the Dragon Campaign. The war started in Serdio with the Violet Dragoon Spirit which Lloyd brought. Their fate, as Dragoons, drags along with Lloyd's fate. Also noted is that after the Humans won the Dragon Campaign, the Dragoons disappeared...does this mean Dart and the others will disappear after their journey is over too?

Albert further says that Dragons are the second most powerful of the 108 species. However, to create balance, Soa lowered the Dragons' intelligence greatly, enabling humans to control them with their wisdom. During the Dragon Campaign, as Kongol noted earlier, the Winglies had Virages, but they couldn't avoid being defeated.

Ute adds some more things to this conversation. He says that Winglies dominated the gods and answered to Melbu Frahma, the Wingly dictator who abused his powers. The anger and sadness of the people fuled the power of the Dragoons and set free the gods from the Winglies. Without their gods, the Winglies were destroyed and the age of Humans had begun. The gods, symbolized by the Moon that Never Sets, now look down upon earth.

Ute also has some information regarding the Black Monster. The Black Monster devours the "Gods", that is, the Moon that Never Sets. He is a demon that appears in various legends and rejects peace, and abhors the idea of a purified world. The so-called "Moon Child" revives the gods on earth and purifies the world, but the Black Monster has always killed the Moon Child so that the world is in never ending chaos. Therefore, the Moon Child "stays forever in the sky".

Rose, in the meantime, visits the unfortunate town of Neet. The town, which is where Dart was born, was destroyed by the Black Monster 18 years ago...but why is Rose there? She goes into the town and finds the Second Sacred Sister Luanna and the Fourth Sacred Sister Setie. It appears that Sister Luanna, like Dart, survived the tragedy of Neet because she is blind, and explains that only those who saw the Moon Child perished. From her flashback, Luanna remembers the Black Monster saying that the Moon Child has a power to turn everyone into an evangelist for the god, a servent to help the gods descend. The Black Monster is not satisfied until everyone who was present at the Moon Child's "birth" is dead. After this, Rose, Luanna, Setie, and the guards all head off to Deningrad.

Meanwhile, Meru visits the town of...Wingly Forest? What's she doing there? Oh my god....could Meru be....*gasp*...a Wingly!? Like Lloyd and Lenus, Meru is indeed a Wingly...and not a very popular one. Everyone in town hates her for leaving to see the "humans"...everyone except her fiance, Guaraha. Even her parents don't like her anymore. But the most furious are the Bardel Brothers, mainly the younger one. She is told by everyone, including Ancestor Blano, the chief of the Winglies, to leave and never return...(poor Meru...)

After this, the scene will come to a mountain, where the Divine Dragon, the King of Dragons with seven wings and seven eyes, breaks free from his imprisonment...but how? One thing is for sure though...he's headed for Deningrad! He attacks the Crystal Palace, but thank goodness no one is hurt.

Our group reunites in Deningrad and goes to see Queen Theresea and her witty daughter, the First Sacred Sister Miranda. Everyone there talks about the Divine Dragon and what it will do. It seems the Winglies sealed the Divine Dragon, but now the Winglies are tense that the Dragon is free, their seal dissolved. It seems only two weapons, the Dragon Buster (which Lloyd has) and the Dragon Block Staff can defeat the Divine Dragon, as both were created by ancient Winglies for this purpose. Luanna is concerned about the Dragoons because another power is influencing them, anticipating it's liberation. They add that the Winglies say their magic draws a line between them and humans. Meru, after some persuasion, decides to show everyone her secret.

Shana has disappeared into the room at the right. She appears to be in one of her "episodes" that no one, not even Dart, can get her out of. When she comes to, she learns about what drew her here. It seems that the Crystal Palace was once a fort for Winglies. The chamber that Shana was in, the Chamber of the Signet, was used for a ceremony for sealing. This is why the Divine Dragon attacked the Crystal Palace, because it was once a home to Winglies. Shana then faints and is brought to the guest room, where her White Silver Dragoon Spirit leaves her body and chooses Miranda as the White Silver Dragoon!

Back to the Evergreen Forest, Meru shows everyone her powers as a...WINGLY!? Everyone is shocked, but the townspeople of Wingly Forest are even more surprised when Meru comes back with humans. However, it appears that Ancestor Blano wishes to speak with the Humans, so the villagers have no other choice but to accept them. In the Tree which houses some Winglies, the group is confronted by the Elder Bardel Brother. He is furious at Meru because she was a role model for his younger sister. When Meru went into the human's world, so did his siter, but humans wound up killing his little sister because she was a Wingly. Though he tries to kill Dart, Dart calmly protects himself with his Dragoon Spirit.

Ancestor Blano, who knows the Dragoons are pure in heart, wants to help. He decides to show the group the Forbidden Land. Also known as Royal Capital Kadessa, it was a palace ground for Winglies during the Dragon Campaign and was also a "Promised Land" for Winglies. Deep within the Forbidden Land is the Dragon Block Staff.

During the journey, the group comes across a "Virage"...it's actually a Virage hybrid that is more powerful than a regular Virage. If you remember the flashback from Rose while she was in the cave, you'll recognize this Virage to be the same that defeated Kanzas. However, this one is still alive...

After a tiring journey through the Forbidden Land, the group comes across the Dragon Block Staff...which is guarded by the Grand Jewel, a mysterious, fierce enemy.

After the defeat of the Grand Jewel, the group heads back to Ancestor Blano, who tells them that they must return to Deningrad immediately...the Divine Dragon is attacking the city! Meru's parents and Guaraha come and help Blano teleport them to Deningrad, but...

It is too late. The Divine Dragon reduces the town to rubble, but Shana's mysterious power enabled her to save the Queen. The only way to stop the Divine Dragon from taking away more lives is to defeat it. Our heroes bravely enter the Mountain of Mortal Dragon, where the King of Dragons resides.

After the winding path to the top of the mountain, our heroes find....LLOYD!!? It appears that it was Lloyd who set free the Divine Dragon, but he could not control it, so he decided to try and kill it. However, even the Dragon Buster was useless against the Divine Dragon. Lloyd leaves and let's those with the Dragon Block Staff fight.

It's a long, grueling battle, but the Dragoons overcome the Dragon...but Lloyd enters the scene again and takes what he wanted the Divine Dragon for...the flame of a soul that sparkles only at the last moment of a dragon's life...the Divine Dragoon Spirit!! It's a good thing the Spirit doesn't recognize him though, or else the world would be nearly doomed. Lloyd tries to escape, but while Rose and Dart attempt to stop him, he knocks them off a cliff. Rose bangs her head, and mutters something about the Black Monster, Moon Child, and Virage Embryo. Once again, the game will flashback to the night Neet was destroyed. Dart feels that Rose knows...something...about these...
