[](http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/evolution.jpg)Evolution

a process in which something passes by degrees to a different stage (especially a more advanced or mature stage);

 

Revolution

a drastic and far-reaching change in ways of thinking and behaving; "the industrial revolution was also a cultural revolution"

 

进化意味着继承，同化，变异

而革命意味着暴力，冲突，政治

 

单纯从生物学角度来比较二者的区别未必是一个很好的切入点

从单词的角度来讲

Revolution is  Re-evolution
