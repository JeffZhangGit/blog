Miranda then speaks about the Moon Mirror that is in the possession of Queen Miranda. The Divine Moon objects were brought by Winglies as a sign of peace, but they held an evil power and that is why they are only passed down by members of the Royal Families of Endiness. This Moon Mirror is also a Divine Moon Object, and surely Lloyd will be after it! It's back to Deningrad!   

[![The Legend of Dragoon（5）Chapter Three: Fate and Soul](http://simg.sinajs.cn/blog7style/images/common/sg_trans.gif)](http://photo.blog.sina.com.cn/showpic.html#blogid=57f94311010005ek&url=http://static14.photo.sina.com.cn/orignal/57f94311fa8c05d6160ad)


While on their way back to Deningrad, Wink, the Third Sacred Sister, will encounter the angry Younger Bardel. He attempts to kill Wink, but Wink is once again saved by....that's right, Lloyd. Lloyd crushes the Younger Bardel, but injures himself in the process. Wink, kind-hearted, takes Lloyd to the Crystal Palace for healing...exactly as Lloyd planned.

However, by the time the Dragoons get to the Crystal Palace, it's too late...Lloyd has already kidnapped the Queen. The group once again pursudes Lloyd in the Kashua Glacier.

The Kashua Glacier has many water-based enemies, so Dart's Heat Blade will be your savior here. Before the group fights Lloyd, they must battle Windigo the viscious ice monster.

After his defeat, our group comes across a weird place called Fort Flanvel, which was once a Wingly Fortress controlled by a man named Faust (more on him later). Flanvel Tower was a fortress during the Dragon Campaign that used to be able to fly as well as float. Of course, this consumed a large amount of magic. This is also where Lloyd is holding Queen Theresea and the Moon Mirror. Lloyd challenges you to a fight.

As Dart goes for the final blow, Wink appears and steps in at the last minute. Trying to control his momentum, Dart accidently slashes her in the back. Wink asks Dart to forgive Lloyd, even though he used her to get to Queen Theresea. It seems someone has a little crush.... ^_~ Anyway, it also appears that Shana has been kidnapped...by Emperor Diaz, Lloyd's boss! He is holding her in Vellweb and demands the Divine Moon Objects. At this time, Lloyd joins your party, but is not a playable character. Lloyd informs them that they must go to Vellweb, beyond Fort Magrad.

While taking a rest in a cave at Fort Magrad, Lloyd has some flashbacks and interesting information. The Three Divine Moon Objects he was after allow the world to be reborn into the utopia that he and Diaz desire. This is Soa's "plan"...to allow the 108th species to be born and create the utopia.

Three years before modern time, Lloyd explains, Diaz believed the world was "rotten" and needed regeneration, an "overture to destruction". The great will of the creator Soa prepared the 108th species, the last species (the last god) to regenerate the world and create the utopia. Notice how it is the 108th species, and how it was said by Fester in Chapter 2 that the Moon that Never Sets wanes every 108 years. There is a connection...the 108th species is the Moon Child! However, as said by Ute, the Black Monster always kills the Moon Child. If this would happen, Lloyd goes on explaining, then the Winglies feared their supreme status reign would end and sealed up the 108th species with Signets. The key to dissolving these Signets are the Divine Moon Objects. Lloyd adds that if he didn't go and do this, someone else would, for no one, not even gods, can escape Soa's will.

Along the way to visiting Emperor Diaz, the group stumbles upon Fort Magrad. Rose explains that Fort Magrad once belonged to humans, and this is where Emperor Diaz declared war on the Winglies. Rose also remembers that her and her lover, Zieg, were supposed to be married after the Dragon Campaign. However, because the Dragoons had descended on Fort Magrad, the Polter Armor, representing the spirits of the soldiers, awakens and challenges the Dragoons.

The group soon arrives in the historic ruin of the human's capital city, Vellweb. In Vellweb there are seven towers representing seven Dragoons and the Holy Throne room where Diaz awaits. Rose explains that, do destroy floating cities like Flanvel, humans shot "battery-powered" arrows. To quote, "That the arrow would not only shear the dakness that covers the earth, but also shear their corrupted hearts which were accustomed to being ruled."

Also awaiting in Vellweb is Shirley. She explains to Rose and the others that the souls of the Dragoons from old are still wandering in the towers. She has come to take the souls of the Dragoons instead of letting them go to Mayfil (more on Mayfil later). Mayfil wants the souls, but Shirely won't let them go there, however she does not have enough power to free them so she anchored the spirits in Vellweb. She asks Rose and the others if, after their meeting with Diaz, they will come back to free the spirits.

At last the group comes to Diaz, who is holding Shana hostage. Diaz explains his only desire is the advent of the last species, which equals total destruction (in other words, "purification") to the whole world. This completely shocks Lloyd and angers him. Diaz was, the whole time, using Lloyd as a pawn to get the Divine Moon Objects, promising Lloyd that he'd build the "utopia" that Lloyd desired for the future of the world, not the destruction of it. Lloyd goes to strike at Diaz, but Diaz attacks Lloyd first, causing poor Lloyd to fall into oblivian.

Diaz explains that the beginning of the world was darkness, and that creator Soa sowed a seed to the earth. This "plan" of Soa, which created all beings, was the Divine Tree. The fruit of the seed ripened and fell to the ground and filled it with life: Gigantos the 97th fruit, Minitos the 99th fruit, Dragons the 105th fruit, humans the 106th fruit, and Winglies the 107th fruit. However, Soa also wanted the destruction/regeneration of the world from the 108th fruit, the Virage Embryo.

However, 11,000 years ago, Winglies found out the tragedy waiting for them and the world, and sealed the 108th fruit by seperating its flesh from its soul. The flesh of the god, the Virage Embryo, was taken away from the Winglies as "The Moon That Never Sets" that glows in the sky and is not affected by time. The soul of the Virage Embryo was kept in a crystal sphere which was in Melbu Frahma's possession. He used the crystal sphere to draw unlimited magical power and used it to conquer the other species. But even with unlimited magic power, domination was not eternal. Humans arose with Dragoons in front. Dragoons were unbeatable because of their powers from the awesome Dragons. Finally, they drove Melbu Frahma into a corner. Zieg closed in on him, preparing for the final blow, but just as he was struck with Zieg's sword, Melbu Frahma petrified Zieg. After 11,000 years the spell wore off. He forgot about his love for Rose, married a girl named Claire, and had a son....named...DART!!? Yep, Zieg is Dart's father. Zieg lived happily with his family until that tragic day in Neet 18 years ago.

Zieg and Rose were considered heroes of the Dragon Campaign. However, humans had made a mistake. The humans destroyed the crystal sphere, which contained the soul of the Virage Embryo. This allowed the Virage Embryo to be born. The soul began to wander, in order to go back to the flesh left in the Moon that Never Sets, to be born the last god, and to destroy/regenerate the world.

The soul, without a body, will possess a human body and go to the Moon that Never Sets, and repeats the transmigration every 108 years. The soul of the god of destruction, the Virage Embryo, goes into a human body, and this human body is known as the Moon Child.

_"Count 108 years and when the Moon that Never Sets glares red the Moon Child descends to the earth and shall give a holy blessing to the world."_

The "Holy Blessing" is destruction. The destruction is Soa's will. This is the fate that rules the future of the world, so explains Diaz. He also adds that there was one Dragoon who found out about "Soa's Will". In order to deter the birth of the God of Destruction, she has had to kill the Moon Children by stopping her own time. She was known as the Black Monster.

The Black Monster, Diaz reveals, is none other then....ROSE!!? Dart doesn't want to believe it, but Rose admits to it.

The Moon Child has to be killed, and the people who saw the Moon Child also have to be killed because the Moon Child turns everyone that sees him/her into a servant for the gods. Rose explains that for 10,000 years there have been no exceptions.

Rose, 18 years ago, killed Princess Louvia (remember the Ghost Ship?), who was the Moon Child, or so Rose thought. But Princess Louvia was not the Moon Child...Louvia had a twin who was the real Moon Child. Louvia's twin is...SHANA!!? This makes Shana the soul of the Virage Embryo, the soul of the God of Destruction.

Yet there is one more surprise...Diaz reveals himself to be....ZIEG!! Zieg takes Shana away and promises to dissolve the Signets of the Moon That Never Sets and cross it with the Moon Child, Shana. Zieg says, as his final words, that this is the will of Soa, and Zieg's hands will start and end the world!!

What will the Dragoons do now? Find out in Chapter Four: Moon and Fate.
