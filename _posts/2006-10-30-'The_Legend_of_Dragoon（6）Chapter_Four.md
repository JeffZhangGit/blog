**READ WITH CAUTION: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**

Our heroes start off in the badlands of the Death Frontier, filled with sandtraps and a ton of enemies. They are looking for a place called Ulara, a secret home of ancient Winglies. Rose, however, feels that what has happened was her fault, and therefore refuses the help of the other Dragoons. Miranda, however, figures the situation is no longer "Rose's problem". Rose thinks Miranda is jumping to conclusions, explaining its not as easy as it seems. The two bitch back and forth until Miranda slaps Rose in the face and ends the fight.

[![The Legend of Dragoon（6）Chapter Four: Moon and Fate](http://simg.sinajs.cn/blog7style/images/common/sg_trans.gif)](http://photo.blog.sina.com.cn/showpic.html#blogid=57f94311010005ep&url=http://static7.photo.sina.com.cn/orignal/57f94311f232342a60b16)

Once the group arrives on a cliff, Rose explains that the choker she wears has special powers: It stops time for herself (making her an immortal) and it opens the city of Ulara. She says that Melbu Frahma's sister, Charle, gave her the choker.

The group finds themselves in the beautiful city of Ulara, where they are told by Caron, an old friend of Rose's, to see Charle.

Before the group meets Charle, they meet a young man who tells them the story of Faust. Faust was the right hand man of Melbu Frahma, and a master wizard and magician, so powerful he could create "clones" of himself. His magical powers made Melbu uneasy and he started to believe that Faust was being disloyal. Melbu Frahma then created the Vanishing Stone to make the clones of Faust disappear. Faust was also the commander of the Floating Fort Flanvel. This Fort was in charge of protecting five other Wingly cities. However, Faust manipulated Flanvel and used it to destroy other species. Eventually, Faust's power-hungry insanity ended Flanvel, and the humans attacked Flanvel from Vellweb with their "battery-powered arrow", thus bringing the once-mighty fortress crashing into Kashua Glacier.

In the city of Ulara is a bed of roses. It is there Miranda says that she hates roses. She believes that "they have thorns to bring out their own red by using the blood of those they hurt." She also explains that she sees her mother (not Queen Theresea) in the roses.

After exploring the town, the group meets Charle, Melbu's older sister.

Surprisingly sweet, the old Wingly has much to say. She explains that in the past, there were five Signet Spheres in five cities, but now only three are left. There was one destroyed in Kadessa during the Dragon Campaign, and the other was lost when the Divine Dragon attacked the Crystal Palace (remember?). The signets "can" be opened without the Divine Moon Objects (the Divine Moon Objects only hold the vast amount of energy which is needed to open the signets). In order to open the signets without the Divine Moon Objects, you merely need to have enough power as a Divine Moon Object.

The group asks how Zieg knew about the Signet Sphere and Shana. Charle says that the Moon that Never Sets, or the 108th fruit that is the God of Destruction that ends the world, was split into mind and soul by the Winglies. They sealed both the mind and soul: The soul was in the Crystal Sphere that Melbu had but was broken during the Dragon Campaign (which allowed the soul to transmigrate into human bodies) and the flesh was the Moon that Never Sets in the sky. When the Moon Child goes to the Moon that Never Sets, the Virage Embryo is born...this is why Rose was hired as the "Black Monster" to kill the Moon Child. Charle further says that she does not understand how Zieg knew and what his intentions are.

But why were the Divine Moon Objects even made? the group asks. Charle says the Melbu insisted so. He had his Crystal Sphere so he could draw unlimited magical powers and rule over all. However, Charle tried to stop him, saying she wanted all to live...so SHE created the SIGNET SPHERES to weaken the Crystal Sphere's magic power. The five signets that protect the Moon that Never Sets restrained the magic power that flows from there (the Moon). Charle thought her inventions were successful...until Meblu created the Divine Moon Objects to destroy her Signet Spheres.

Charle adds that the three remaining Signet Spheres are located in Magical City Aglis, Law City Zenebatos, and Death City Mayfil. Rose is amazed that these ancient cities are still alive.

After the long talk, Charle will dismiss the group. They will then split up. Dart makes his promise to find Shana. He will then go to Rose. The scene will fade to the Death Frontier, where the two of them fought. Dart defeated Rose, but he decided not to kill her since he considered the Black Monster to be already dead. Dart and Rose will go to the bar where they find Miranda and Haschel drinking and telling stories. Dart and Rose join them in a drink. The group finds King Albert and Kongol in the weapons store. They think that they will need powerful weapons for their next journey. Meru is on the outskirts of town talking with Caron. The next morning, all the Winglies gather to wish the Dragoons good-bye and good luck.

The group finds themselves in The Land of the Gigantos. They make their way past that, through the Valley of Corrupted Gravity, the Barrens, and then back to Fletz. The King informs Dart and the group that a dock for the Queen Fury has been built to take them wherever they need to go. On the boat, the group sails to Rogue, which is supposed to be where the Magic City Aglis once was.

Haschel is delighted to go to Rogue...it's his hometown! Everyone in the village is like an extended family, they know one another and are delighted to see Haschel and his friends (the mayor is especially grateful to see Haschel). They tell Haschel of a giant "stick" out on the sea. The group goes on a deck and sees the stick. Haschel explains that it was not there 20 years ago when he left Rogue to look for his daughter. Rose then tells you about the different ancient cities. Deningrad, which was known as the "Birth City", was were babies were born. However, not all babies could live. The ones with the weakest magic powers were killed. Kadessa, now the Forbidden Land, was the Wingly Capital dominated by Melbu Frahma. It was the center of politics and military. The Death City Mayfil was where the souls of the dead were sent to go to the infernal world. Winglies controlled Mayfil because they wanted to rule the lives of everyone...even the dead. Law City Zenebatos was where Wingly laws were made. Publicly, the Winglies said the laws were made for justice, but in reality they were used to judge other species. Trials and executions were also held in Zenebatos. Magical City Aglis was were magic was studied. At one time, all these cities could float.

After the talk, the "stick" comes out of the ocean...and this "stick" is really the Magical City Aglis! The group decides to go and check it out.

In Aglis the Dragoons meet many friendly and not-so-friendly creatures. However, it seems the friendly creatures (Ruff, Spino, Phewy, and Buckle) all know about Rose. Following the magical creatures, the group finds an old Wingly named Savan. Savan has survived the Dragon Campaign (thanks to Rose) and has waited for the Dragoons. He has continued to study magic. He explains he created the magical creatures to work for him and keep him company. He has been watching Rose and the Dragoons through a telescreen, and has figured out a way to make a weapon to help them defeat Zieg. It is known as the Psychadelic Bomb, and all he needs to finish it is the courage of the Dragoons. Each Dragoon takes a test so Savan can determine their courage. The more courage they have, the more powerful the Psychadelic Bomb will be.

Savan also explains his plan for "Moot"...the new, more powerful Signet Sphere he is creating to replace the old one. He also created Last Kraken to protect the Signet Sphere...at least Last Kraken WOULD protect the Signet Sphere if ZIEG hadn't taken over its body! It's up to the Dragoons to stop the brainwashed Last Kraken but even their efforts have failed. The power of the Dragoons have caused a chain reaction in the magic-sensitive world of Aglis, and this causes Moot to resonate and break the Signet! To make things worse, Aglis is falling apart. Zieg destroys the Moon Mirror since he doesn't need it to break the Signet. To save the Dragoons, Savan magically teleports them to safety, but it cost him his life. The Dragoons hurry back, trying to escape. The magical creatures, using the last of their powers, open a locked door. It is a teleporter to the Law City Zenebatos.

In the Law City, they meet a huge creature named Coolon. Coolon explains that he is the "Wings of Savan" and will take them to the major cities in Endiness. Even though he can't take you directly to the Signet Sphere, Coolon is very helpful. On the higher platform on Zenebatoes, Guide Lapto 00 explains that there is a law, Wingly Code Article 703, preventing non-Winglies from seeing the Signet. Even though Meru is a Wingly, she doesn't have enough magic power to be recognized. What the Dragoons need to do now is change the law, which is an annoying procedure.

First, the Dragoons head off to the Legislation Center, but while on the way, they get caught by a guard! They get teleported to a prison, but something is missing....."BOOM!!" In comes Kongol to save the team. Rose suggests that Kongol is too heavy to be teleported. Our team gets back on track and arrives at the Legislation Center Council. There, they are granted permission to change Law 703. The Dragoons get the Law Production Liscense which they need to take to the Law Factory. There, they speak with Lapto 64, to whom they give the Law Production License. In return, Lapto 64 gives them the Law Launching License. The group takes the Law Launching License to Lapto 17 in the Law Launching area. He'll launch the law, and by the time the team gets back to the first Lapto, the new law allowing non-Winglies going to the Signet Sphere will be underway.

However, in the court where the Signet Sphere is held, the Laptos have gathered and are accusing the Dragoons of treason to Soa. The punishment is death by the winged executioners Kubila, Vector, and Selebus! The Dragoons must now save their hides by battling the trio to the death.

After another victory for our heroes, they run off to save the Signet Sphere...but it is too late. Zieg has already broken the sphere with the Moon Dagger. Dart will try to stop his father, but to no avail.

Having no other choice, the Dragoons must change the 410th Law through the same process as changing 703. This way, our heroes make it to the final Signet Sphere in Mayfil, the Death City.

According to Rose, Mayfil directs the souls to hell and is perhaps connected to devildom. Winglies would suck souls into a huge tower, then decide where the souls would go. Mayfil was supposedly destroyed during the Dragon Campaign, which is why Rose is surprised it's still around. She thinks that the souls that didn't die completely gather there, including those of dragons.

She was very right. The souls of Feyrbrand, Regole, and the Divine Dragon are still hanging around here. The defeat of the Winglies by the less powerful humans was actually a burden on the dragons' souls. Also, the souls of the Dragons still have a bond with their Dragoon Spirits, and the only way to free them from their bind is to kill the souls. This also sets the souls free so that the Dragons won't be overwhelmed by the power in Mayfil and go to hell. With the Divine Dragon, however, the team needs to defeat his pride which binds him to the world, and therefore making his soul extremely difficult to defeat.

While journeying in Mayfil, Rose comes to a room filled with the souls of the people she has killed while she was the Black Monster. The people hate the Black Monster and are glad that she (the Black Monster) is dead.

Towards the end, the group finds another surprise...it's Lavitz! However, he is acting very strange....Rose explains that the souls in Mayfil hang around with a variety of thoughts that attract them to the gates of hell. Negative thoughts ("attatchments" to the real world) are favorites of the devils from hell. These same devils are controlling Mayfil and one of these devils has possessed Lavitz. It seems Lavitz was attatched to the world because he was worried about Dart and the others. Zachwell the devil took advantage of this and invaded Lavitz' soul. The Dragoons now have the task of freeing Lavitz from Zachwell.

Though Zachwell possessed Lavitz' soul, Lavitz is grateful for it...because it allowed him to see his friends one last time, even after his death. Using the last of his strength, Lavitz opens a portal to the Signet Sphere high on Mayfil.
