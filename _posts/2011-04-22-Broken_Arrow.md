Broken Arrow

Pixie Lott

What do you do when you're stuck,   
Because the one that you love,   
Has pushed you away,   
And you can't deal with the pain,   
And now you're trying to fix me,   
Mend what he did,   
I'll find the piece that i'm missing,   
But I still miss him,   
I miss him, i'm missing him,   
Oh I miss him, I miss him i'm missng him   
And you're sitting in the front row,   
Wana be first in line,   
Sitting by my window,   
Giving me all your time,   
You could be my hero,   
If only I could let go,   
But his love has still hit me,   
Like a broken arrow.   
Like a broken arrow.   
He's the thorn in my flesh   
That I can't take out   
He's stealing my breath   
When you're around,   
And now you're trying to convince me,   
He wasn't worth it,   
But you can't complete me,   
It's the thought that he's missing,   
I miss him, I'm missing him,   
Oh I miss him I miss him, i'm missing him,   
And you're standing in the front row,   
Wana be first in line,   
Sitting by my window,   
Giving me all your time,   
You could be my hero,   
If only I could let go,   
But his love has still hit me,   
Live a broken arrow,   
Like a broken arrow.   
What do you do   
When your hearts in two places?   
You feel great but you're torn inside.   
You feel love but you just can't embrace it,   
When you found the right one at the wrong time.   
And you're   
Standing in the front row,   
Wanna be first in line,   
Sitting by my window,   
Giving me all your time,   
You could be my hero,   
If only I could let go,   
But his love still hit me,   
Like a broken arrow.   
Like a broken arrow...
