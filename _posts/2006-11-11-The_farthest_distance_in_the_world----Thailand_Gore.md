****is not in two distant trees.
****it is the same rooted branches
 can't enjoy the co-existance.**


**So the most distant way in the world
 is not in the being sepearated branches.
 it is in the blinking stars
 they can't burn the light.**

**So the most distant way in the world
 is not the burning stars.
 it is after the light
 they can't be seen from afar.**

**So the most distant way in the world
 is not the light that is fading away.
 it is the coincidence of us
 is not supposed for the love.**

**So the most distant way in the world
 is the love between the fish and bird.
 one is flying at the sky,
 the other is looking upon into the sea.**
